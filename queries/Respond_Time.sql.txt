    SQL QUERY --ENRON EMAIL DATA (SLACK CODING CHALLENGE)
    By Daniel Kristiyanto

    QUESTION: Find the five emails with the fastest response times. (A response is defined as a message from one of the recipients to the original sender whose subject line contains all of the words from the subject of the original email, and the response time should be measured as the difference between when the original email was sent and when the response was sent.)

    ANSWER:
    A Subquery to find the send and response messages (with the same subject) are performed, returning Message-IDs of both Message. 
    The Message-IDs then Left Join-ed with the header to calculate the time differences (absolute value in seconds).
    If necessary, this can be further joined with `recipients` Table
    to find the recipients of the messages (e.g for debugging)

    ASSUMPTIONS:
    - Both Enron email and external organization emails are treated similarly
    - Messages with NULL Subjects are not evaluated
    - Message sent to self are not evaluated
