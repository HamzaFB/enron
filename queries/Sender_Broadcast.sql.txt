    SQL QUERY --ENRON EMAIL DATA (SLACK CODING CHALLENGE)
    By Daniel Kristiyanto

    QUESTION: Let's label an email as "direct" if there is exactly one recipient and "broadcast" if it has multiple recipients. Identify the person (or people) who received the largest number of direct emails and the person (or people) who sent the largest number of broadcast emails.

    ANSWER:
    This script is to answer the second portion of the question (to find the people who sent most email with recipients > 1).

    This is done by creating a table which contain information about the number of message sent by a sender (excluding direct message) as a view. Another query is performed to filter out only the recipients with max number.



    ASSUMPTIONS:
    - Both Enron email and external organization emails are treated similarly
    - Sender with average recipients overtime are considered as the largest number of broadcast email
    - Only DISTINCT recipients are performed (e.g if a recipient is included in both To and CC, is considered as 1 recipient)
*/


/*
    Creating a view with total of Broadcast

CREATE VIEW broadcast AS
SELECT Sender,
COUNT(h.`Message-ID`) AS N
FROM header h
INNER JOIN
    (SELECT r.`Message-ID` FROM recipients r
     GROUP BY r.`Message-ID` HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Recipient) > 1 
    ) filter
ON h.`Message-ID` = filter.`Message-ID`
GROUP BY Sender
ORDER BY N DESC; 

/*
    Get all senders who sent most of broadcast emails
*/

SELECT * FROM broadcast 
WHERE N = (SELECT MAX(N) FROM broadcast);
