/* 
    SQL QUERY --ENRON EMAIL DATA (SLACK CODING CHALLENGE)
    By Daniel Kristiyanto

    QUESTION: How many emails did each person receive each day?

    ANSWER:
    A query to count the number of recieved messages are performed.
    If a recipient are mentioned more than once (eg. in both To and CC) in an email, this will be considered as 1 message.

    ASSUMPTIONS:
    - Both Enron email and external organization emails are treated similarly
    - Only DISTINCT recipients are performed (e.g if a recipient is included in both To and CC, is considered as 1 recipient)
*/

SELECT 
    DISTINCT CAST(Date AS DATE) as Date, 
    Recipient, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.`Message-ID`) as `Received` 

FROM recipients r 
LEFT JOIN header h ON r.`Message-ID` = h.`Message-ID` 

GROUP BY CAST(Date AS DATE), Recipient ORDER BY CAST(Date AS DATE), Recipient;
